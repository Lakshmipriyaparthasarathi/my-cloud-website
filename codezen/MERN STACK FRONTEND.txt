To design the web page :
In src folder>>app.js file>> in return command dlete the existing codes and type the code to design the web page.
when giving <h1></h1> to <h6></h6> commands make sure to wrap them in <div></div> commands    if it is single <h1></h1> commands no need to wrap...

INSERT IMAGES:

download some images from the chrome and copythe pictures and put into the public folder....
if u need to use the images without downloading means...just copy the link address of the image and and paste it after the same code src and save it...now u will get the output.

Default port for react js is "localhost3000"
