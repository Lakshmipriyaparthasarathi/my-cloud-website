WHY REACT.JS?

When we create websites using HTML,css and s  -> DOM9Document object midel) is created
Here after developing the website ,whenever we make any changes once the change is done,complete application will be rerendered which is not efficient.

whereas in react js VDOM(Virtual DOM) gets created, so instead of complete application getting rerendered the area where we are making changes only that part only rerendered which is efficient.

NOTE :
  To develop complex web applications like E commerce website(amazon,flipcart) react is highly recommended...

Using react we create componenets...

TYPES OF COMPONENTS:

1) Class components
2) functional components
Components name should ALlways starts whith capital.
one function componnents consists of(skeleton) :

  " function name(){
      alert("Hello React");
      return();   }"

                            [name()= should start with capital letter eg app)



alert box commands should be given in frst part of function
