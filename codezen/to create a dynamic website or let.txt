to create a dynamic website or let say we want to make our websites or web applns with lot of interactions by adding functionalities here we're using js 
Now to make those websites more effective we're using one of the js library which is called react.js

JS X:
It is javascript xml writing HTML inside javascript file 
WHY REACT.JS?
when we create websites using html,js,css DOM(Document Obj Model) gets created,here after developing the website whenever we make any changes once the change is done complete application will be rerendered which is not efficient 

whereas In react.js VDOM(Virtual DOM) gets created so instead of complete appln getting rerendered the area where we're making changes only that part will be rerendered which is efficient

NOTE:
>>To develop complex web applns like Ecommerce websites(Amazon,Flipcart) react is highly recommended
>>using react we create components 

TYPES OF COMPONENTS
>>Class Components
>>Functional Components
components name should start with uppercase
 
fuction App(){      
    return (
            <h1>heading</h1>
             alert("hello react"); #to give alert msg in the notification bar
           );
           </div>
         }

this is the component
