SERVER :

Server sits as a middle man inbetween client and database.. server is responsible to react for the both request and response.

EXAMPLE: browser( trying to search for something..so as a client u are sending a request..server takes the request..grab the information from the database and server sending u the response for ur request that is the result what we are getting after search.

MERNSTACK BACKEND :

Here we are using express.js as backend or middleware..this express.js is a library or framework from node.js

============================================================================

SERVER.JS [BACKEND WORK]

require is a keyword used to set up or bring in express

split the 2 terminals in cmd below the vs code..
now take the 1 as front end and next as backend..then in create a server folder and create a server.js file in that file put this code...before that in the backend command put this command npm I express...to instll the express.js....

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3005;
const message = "Hello,lp!";
app.get('/message', (req, res) => {
    res.json({message});
});
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

save this code and in the backend put the node server.js and it seems like server is running..then go to browser and type localhost:3005/message...then u will get the page "HELLO FRONTEND!"....
